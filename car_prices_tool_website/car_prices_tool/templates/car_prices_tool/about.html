                    Hello! On this mockup SaaS website without registering you can search my database by make and model
                    of the car.
                    After you create an account and you will log in you can select various filters like price, year of
                    production, mileage and many more. Since you created account you can use all available filters (that
                    non registered users cannot) you can make 10 searches per 24 hours. But if you click button "Go
                    Premium" you will be granted new "Premium" rank that will let you make 100 searches per 24 hours.
                    It is a mockup SaaS after all.
                    <br><br>
                    I created this website in order to train my programming skills. In development I used
                    Django, Python, HTML, CSS, BootStrap and a little bit of JavaScript (thanks
                    <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/" target="_blank">Chart.js</a>) and Ajax. In order to gain data
                    for cars database I used web scraping with Scrapy and Docker for hosting my spider on VPS server.
                    <br><br>
