    This command was written to automate process of importing data from json file to django models.
    Json file is being prepared by Scrapy spider with cars data. Each time this command is called,
    old data is being deleted and new one is being imported. Additional field 'price_dollars' is
    being added to make comparing cars with different price currencies easier.
    You can call this command by writing 'python manage.py import_data_json'.
